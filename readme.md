# Final Project
 Name: Byte Bank JS
## Main Goals
 Understand and apply the methods below: 
  - Encapsulation (example: Account) 
  - Polymorphism - Ducky Type (example SystemAuthentication) 
## What I learned in this project
> I divided the phases of the project into branches.

### Project Account - Method: Encapsulation
Phase1-1 - Repeating Code
  - Creating classes
  - What are attributes
  - Instance / Object
  - New operator

  Phase1-2 - Adding behaviors
  - Creation of methods
  - Keyword this
  - Encapsulation
  - Proposed private attributes
  - return and early return

  Phase1-3 - Modularizing Code
  - Package.json
  - Modules
  - importation / exportation
  - What are the advantages of having a code where classes and composition  - when obtaining from primitive types
  - Value types and reference types
  - Dynamically changing an object

  Phase1.4 - Accessing Private Attributes
  - Differences between null and undefined
  - Deepening the concepts of references to a memory space
  - Get and Set
  - Best-in-class package
  - Protecting related attributes

  Phase1-5 - Accessing Private Attributes
  - Constructors
  - Encapsulation
  - Attributes "only reading"
  - Static attributes

  ### Project System Authentication - Method: Polymorphism 
  Phase2-1 - Customer Issues
  - Class, Properties
  - Good practices when declaring attributes
  - Always declaring properties as initially private
  - Code duplication issues
  - Shared code issues

  Phase2-2 - Heritage
  - Specializing code
  - Inheriting properties and attributes
  - Overload of methods
  - Sharing code securely
  - Keeping our code in the client's language
  - Avoiding very complicated code through inheritance
  - Super keyword
  - Private and protected method and properties

Phase2-3 - Customer Issues
  - How JS knows who is being instantiated
  - Weighing in protecting our system
  - Throwing errors to the system
  - Abstract classes
  - Abstract methods
  - Runtime errors

Phase2-4 - Customer Issues
  - Inheritance review, good code practices and encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
  - Static methods
  - Ways to treat objects of different types in a similar way

Phase2-5 - Customer Issues
  - instanceOf operator
  - How to protect our systems
  - standardized interfaces
  - Ducky type
